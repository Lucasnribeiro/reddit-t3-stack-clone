# Reddit Clone using T3 Stack

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## About and Motivation

This project started as a challenge for myself. I wanted to test my habilities and see where I fit as a programmer in the market (junior, mid, senior).
I've been looking for some international job oportunities so I needed to understand how well I can apply my skills.

The project had two rules: Look as similar as possible to current reddit using Tailwind and resemble the functionality of it.
I think the similarity was archieved and also the functionality (of course with several limitations).

### Current Functionalities
- Create a subreddit
- Post to a subreddit
- Post a image to a subreddit
- Comment a Post
- Reply to a comment or another reply
- Join a subreddit
- Edit subreddit title and picture
- Search posts, users and subreddits
- Filter the timeline based on algorithms (very simplistic though)

### Future updates
- Delete and edit a post
- Add moderators and admins to subreddits
- Delete and edit comments and replies
- Moderator habilities to redact a post, comment or reply or delete
- Notifications on new interactions (eg.: new comment on a user post)

## Current known problems
- the user profile page is not finished
- the navigation dropdown doesn't update based on the current subreddit being viewed

## Issues
